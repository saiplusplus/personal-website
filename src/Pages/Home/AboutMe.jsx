                        I am a dual degree computer science and industrial engineering student at Georgia Tech. I enjoy presenting, speech writing, organizing teams, and spending time with my younger brother.

                        My grand vision in life is to make air travel so efficent that it becomes as affordable and convenient as public transportation. I hope to contribute to teams that are working to make that vision a reality. My second grand vision is to create a succesful family conglomerate dipping my toes in entertainment and hospitality.
