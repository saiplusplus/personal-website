            "description" : "My first year at Georgia Tech was insanely difficult, I was not prepared for my life to change so drastically from being a naive school kid to, well a naive school kid on the opposite side of the country. But getting this position for CS 1331 Intro to Object Oriented Programming, the single largest class at Georgia Tech, was a boon for me as it gave me my \"niche\". It gave me a way to continue doing what I like doing and what I am better than anyone else at: presenting, teaching, and entertaining. I think I got this job mainly because I applied and my grade in the class but who knows maybe they liked my interview. I wasn't actually part of the first batch of new TAS hired by our professor, I was part of the second batch that came after some people left so I think I was an afterthought. But I was determined not to fade into the background like an afterthought, nobody overlooks Sai. My primary responsibility as a TA is to grade student programs and exams, teach a recitation section of about 20 people (8 regulars), and write test cases for student programs. But as someone from the second batch, I was determined to knock it out of the park. My masterstroke came in recitation instruction. In my first few days I noticed that students got bored really quickly, tapping out and doing something else on their computer and I didn't like that. Sai does not want to give a Sai presentation to an audience that ain't payin attention. So I put myself into the students' shoes which wasn't hard cause I'm a student myself anyway and go to other class recitations and realized that no matter what I do, student nature is to wander off. When we have a computer in front of us you know we are gonna drift into email, games, or other schoolwork. I couldn't fight the computer. So then what could I possibly do to beat the computer for our students' attention. Then it struck me, I had to beat the computer at its own game. I developed a whole new kind of recitation, the PointSolutions recitation. PointSolutions was a software our school paid for that among other things, could be used to make interactive powerpoint presentations. This means polling students in between slides with a question they could answer on their own devices. Bingo. Now I wasn't gonna do the professor thing of just asking students boring questions on PointSolutions. No, I created a trivia style game based on actual exam questions (that I remembered from my time in the class I didn't steal from the actual exam, just want to make that clear). This trivia solution was simply beautiful. You see students were still gonna drift away, its expected. However, when that PointSolutions slide came up it forced everyone to go back to the slides and actually understand what we're yapping about at the front of the class. Boom, not only did my students have fun but they could actually distill all the information they needed. With my two recitation partners I ran the greatest recitation section of CS 1331 and I am proud of that, and I will continue innovating for the betterment of the student.",

AvtechTyee (subsidiary of TransDigm NYSE: TDG) is a leading manufacturer of avionics and structural equipment for many of the world's most popular aircraft. My boy Aditya got an Engineering Internship for himself at the company through mystic means he wouldn't really explain but I asked him do you think they'd take me in and he said sure. Bless his soul because he talked to HR and actually got me a position, I will forever be indebted. Now I kinda wanted to be an engineering intern myself but of all things he got me an accounting internship, but I didn't care God Bless his beautiful soul. Good lord this was a real company part of a 70 billion dollar corporation where I could do real work. Heavans almighty it was one of the coolest experiences of my life. Now most of my work is protected by NDA and I am now well aware of ITAR and EAR so I won't say much. The finance team was awesome and I got to learn from each of them the intricacies of the finance of aeropsace.  I was tasked with working with different departments within the company to discover financial opportunities hidden throughout the company's reserve account. This meant locating fully-reserved parts, developing a gameplan for them (selling them to our suppliers, selling on the open market, or scrapping them), and putting that plan into action. Aside from my main project, I assisted in various finance and engineering needs. Coordinating communications between VPs and Directors of different company divisions, participating in intense conference room meetings, advocating for solutions that made the company real money. Surveying the vast manufacturing facility to develop gameplans for various fully-reserved parts. Working with people from all functional divisions of the company, not just in finance, towards a shared financial vision. Learning Generally-Accepted-Accounting-Principles on the job. God bless Avtech Tyee, truly a gem of a company.",
